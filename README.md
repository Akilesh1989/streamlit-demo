# Exploring the Titanic dataset using Streamlit

The idea behind this repo is to explore the functionalities of Streamlit. I do this by trying to build an app that explores the Titanic dataset.
You can watch how the app works in this [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/jyq5jQxXUHQ).



# Running the app
First install all the required packages by running,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then simply run,
```
streamlit run run.py
```

This will automatically open a webpage where you can view the app.
